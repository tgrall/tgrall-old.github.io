  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am very excited to say that this week is my first week as an employee
of eXo Platorm. Excited for many reasons&hellip;. I&rsquo;ll pass on the
excitement of a new job, we are all excited about that&hellip; So what are
the others reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>working for open source</li>
<li>be part of a visionary team/product.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Working for open source</h4>

<p>Some of you know that I have been working for Oracle from 1999 to 2007,
and lately for Sogeti (Cap Gemini Group) that is one of the biggest
IBM&rsquo;s partner&hellip; So moving to eXo Platform an open source company is
definitively a big shift for me. Anyway, I was looking for more “agile”
working environment&hellip;.</p>

<p>I am pleased to work for a product where users can follow on a daily
basis what is the exact status of the different features, not from
marketing slides but directly from the source trunk&hellip; But also where
any user can influence the product either by providing direct feedback
to the developers using mailing lists, tracking tools and wikis; even
more if they want to participate to the development itself.</p>

<p>So being open source, will avoid some kind of lock-in, but this is not
the only point: standards is another important point. eXo Platform,
since its first release in 2003, has been great about defining,
supporting and implementing standards. So eXo Portal is a great
implementation of a JSR-168 portlet container, and it is today also one
of the first portal and portlet container supporting the new JSR-286
Java Portlet API. In addition to the Java Portlet API support, it is
also possible to consume remote portlet using WSRP 1&amp;2. As you
can see eXo Portal is a great solution to implement and integrate an
enterprise portal based on standards. In addition to portal standard,
eXo is also providing a powerful ECM that is based on a Java Content
Repostory (JCR/JSR-170) implementation.</p>

<p>Based on the fact that eXo is open source and support industry
standard
it is a great tool to use; and it has been chosen by some other
projects for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>NovaForge: an innovative Forge platform that aggregates and
glue
several Open Source tools used for Software Developments such as SVN
repositories, Bug trackers, Continuous build… It used eXo WebOS and ECM
to provide a single access points to all the resources as you can see
in the following screenshot.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3087/2586150929_85d1f80644_m.jpg" title="Novaforge and eXo WeboS" ></p>

<ul>
<li>Bonita: is an open source workflow and BPM that is using
eXo WebOS to
expose its console, as you can see in the following screenshot</li>
</ul>


<p>You also have other softwares that are using various part of the product from te JCR to the Portlet Container&hellip; it depends a lot of your needs&hellip;</p>

<h4>Working with visionary team and product</h4>

<p>eXo Platform is a lot more than en enterprise portal. The core architecture of eXo is based on an internal SOA built at the top of an IoC container (Pico Container). This architecture has been leveraged in many point to expose new services and assemble all the components of the eXo Platform suite.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a quick look to the components of eXo Platform:</p>

<ul>
<li>eXo Portal 2.0: create and publish your portal
using a simple
and powerful Ajax based user interface</li>
<li>eXo ECM 2.0: manage all your digital assets that are stored
in the JCR,
and expose them using many protocols (WebDac, FTP, CIFS, &hellip;)* eXo CS 1.0: collaborate inside and outside your enterprise
using shared
calendars, WebMail, Forums and Contact Management</li>
<li>eXo WebOS 1.0: virtualize your desktop in this revolutionary user
interface, where you can expose portlets and widgets and run any Web
applications.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3262/2586521963_56fece571a_m.jpg"></p>

<p>In addition to these component that are available today in the eXo Ultimate distribution or as stand alone solution, you can see in the source trunk:</p>

<ul>
<li>LiveRoom: a Web based real time collaborative tools allowing shared whiteboard, visioconference/VoIP using once again your browser, (in fact we have been implementing  it using Flash/Flex)</li>
<li>WCM: Web CMS System that is extending the ECM to facilitate Web site publishing.</li>
<li>and many other features&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>One last example of the vision of the eXo Platform is the fact that all services could be exposed either as REST Services using the JSR-311(JAX-RS) or as SOAP Services using the JSR-181 (Annotations based services).</p>

<p>One of the feature that I am currently watching closely is the implementation and support of Open Social standard, that allows easy integration of &ldquo;social-applications&rdquo; with other very hot subjects for
    the “Enterprise 2.0” such as social networks, mashups and so on&hellip;</p>

<p>Stay tuned, and take the time to download and install eXo Platform&hellip;</p>

<p>As a closure, I just invite you to take a look to eXo and contact me if you have any question about the product or if you have.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We are all badly impacted with the price of oil. Yeah it really expensive,
now people is the US have a gas that is as expensive as France&rsquo;s
prices, shocking! ;).</p>

<p>Anyway, I do not want to talk about cars and gas, but really on the
good effect of the expensive oil. I do believe that expensive oil has
good impacts, not for my bank account but for the &ldquo;planet&rdquo;, and may be
indirectly for software industry.</p>

<h4>Change in transportation</h4>

<p>First of all, we are all forced to try to save gaz/enegy to save money. So people are thinking more about alternative to &ldquo;individual car driving&rdquo;: carpooling, public
transportations are more often used these days. I
addition, people are using public bikes that you can find
more and more in cities now. Nantes, where I live has launched its new
program &ldquo;<a href="http://www.bicloo.nantesmetropole.fr/">Bicloo</a>&rdquo;. So not only people are changing
but I am sure industrials will also adapt to this offering greener
alternative to oil for transportation. Personally, I would like to buy
a cheap
electric car to be able to go in the city, at least to reach the
various Park&amp;Ride points. I have to say that I really like the<a href="http://www.google.org/recharge/">
Google RecharcheIT</a> initiative, that is used to charge plug-in
hybrid cars&hellip; This is enough for the &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; and cars&hellip;.</p>

<h4>Change in way we do work</h4>

<p>I believe also that expensive oil will have an impact on the way we do
work: we must try to avoid traveling all the time. Some work could be
done just using the Internet and good collaborative tools. When most of
a work is about: reading mail, phone talks, and meetings all these
activities could be done using &ldquo;IT&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t?</p>

<p>I used to work from home a lot when I was working for Oracle HQ from
France: the working kit is quite simple and not that expensive: laptop,
fast Internet connection, VoIP phone, VPN and a Collaborative
Suite (webmail, shared calendar, web conference tools, social networks, &hellip;). Using this simple set of tools I was as productive as any employee but without
 traveling that much. I do not say that we should all work from home or smal local office, but we should try to do it. And limit our endless travels, that burns so much energy for CO2&hellip;. Yes all the IT is also consuming energy, but I do believe that it is probably easy to make IT industry &ldquo;greener&rdquo; than car industry&hellip; (I might be wrong&hellip;), but still at the office we will use computers/IT anyway..</p>

<p>So many of the software vendor are offering tools to make us more productive using the &ldquo;network as the computer&rdquo; -we all remember this-.
One example of tools that in fact is &ldquo;greener&rdquo; is <a href="http://www.exoplatform.org">eXo Platform</a>. eXo provides all the tools for collaborative work: personalized portal, webmail, chat, shared calendar, &hellip; and soon
  LiveRoom that is the Web conference/VoIP solution integrated to your   navigator (Flex based application). In addition to this, users can also
  virtualized their desktop using eXo WebOS, and access his work   environment from everywhere&hellip; I know that other solutions are available on the market, from various vendors such as Oracle, IBM,   Microsoft, I have chosen eXo first of all it is an open source project where any user can participate at least by asking from requirements   proposing ideas, but also and mainly because its offering is based on industry standards that will help integration to any existing IT   systems. (&hellip; and also because I am currently working closely with the eXo team&hellip;)</p>

<h4>IT for a greener world</h4>

<p>In conlusion, we, IT folks can I have some impact on the environment by helping people to be more effective when doing remote work, avoiding useless commute&hellip; Clearly, the technologies are avaiable today to help us, to work efficiently from home or &ldquo;virtual offices&rdquo; the main constraints are coming from enterprise/management culture.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/themes/techcrunch/techcrunch.gif">
Like many of you I am following <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a>, and one of the latest post was quite &ldquo;amazing&rdquo;:</p>

<ul>
<li>see the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/25/twitter-2/">Twitter!</a> post from Michael Arrigton.More than the post itself, the comments that this single word generated is quite funny: so far we have 291 comments&hellip; As you can guess I have not read (all of) them&hellip; But something is interesting, you can see that many people have used <a href="http://www.seesmic.com/">Seesmic </a>to drop a video comment.
<a href="http://www.seesmic.com/"><img src="http://api.seesmic.com/images/seesmic_logo.png" alt="" /></a></li>
</ul>


<p>I have to say that I am quite impressed by the large number of comments that have  been made using Seesmic.  Bravo to Loic Lemeur&rsquo;s vision for this tools&hellip; This is simply the new and easy way to really do the &ldquo;read/write&rdquo; Web, I should say &ldquo;record/watch&rdquo; Web.</p>

<p>One thing is still bothering me, how to I find interesting content that is saved using Seesmic?</p>

<p>Yes, I can use social features to subscribe to people that are sharing similar center of interest.  But I cannot find any folksonomy on Seesmic, am I missing it, or it is just not available yet?</p>

<p>Or let&rsquo;s dream and imagine than Web search/index engine will be able to index these video content to help me to find interesting content -may be this exists but I have not found it yet-.  Loic, is it your next big feature to transform Seesmic in the next killer app?</p>

<p>So far I do not have the feeling that I missed anything -watch the comments and you will understand-, but it looks like people love to use the video to discuss/share with others, and I can understand why&hellip; We have moved from technical tools: Complex Web Authoring Platform, to easy Blog publishing, to pure video recording tool, so very easy indeed. I can imagine my mother posting a comment to a blog or video now&hellip; thanks to Seesmic!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lately, I have been presenting Web 2.0 tools to my coworkers, and explaining how it could be used to improve the way we do &ldquo;things&rdquo; (especially business). Here a list of some of the tools I am talking about blogs, wikis, second life, social networking/bookmarking/tagging/rating,, facebook, friendfeed, youtube, seesmic, feeddo, flock and many others depending of the questions and the mood of the moment&hellip;</p>

<p>One of the tool that I love to present is Twitter&hellip; and now I have an good example of why we all need to be on Twitter ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, I have been surprised when I saw the following announcement:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.liferay.com/web/guest/about_us/news/sun">Sun Microsystems Joins Liferay Open Source Community / Sun&rsquo;s new Web platform to leverage core elements of Liferay Portal 5.0.</a>One interesting thing is  Brian Chan&rsquo;s blog entry about <a href="http://www.liferay.com/web/bchan/blog/-/blogs/liferay_and_sun?_33_redirect=%2Fweb%2Fguest%2Fcommunity%2Fblog">Liferay and Sun</a> explaining how they have been working together so far&hellip; to fill the limitations of each other solutions.</li>
</ul>


<p>So today what does that means? Liferay is leveraging the development power of Sun to implements standards (for example JSR-286). I have always been frustrated by the lack of standard support and &lsquo;real&rsquo; innovation in Liferay (compare to its competitors such as <a href="http://www.exoplatform.org/">eXo Platform</a>, and Jboss for example). In the other hand Sun will leverage the &ldquo;tiny Liferay product&rdquo; killing its own solution. Sun&rsquo;s portal is really to big without that benefits for developers/users (compare to its competitors, BEA,IBM, Oracle for example).</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the next step for this partnership? If Sun wants to push a real portal offering, it can only finish by a full acquisition of Liferay&hellip; even if it is stated that it is not the plan.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s wait and see how this &ldquo;WebSynergy&rdquo; goes&hellip; However one thing is cool, it will put more visibility on Enteprise Portals. With all the Web 2.0 stuff: social computing, mashups, collaborative works/intelligence, the need for &ldquo;Enterprise Portal&rdquo; (I should add a 2.0) is back stronger than before&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Friday (April 18th) I was attending the launch of &ldquo;eXo WebOS&rdquo; in Paris. Benjamin Mestrallet, creator of eXo has started the event with a presentation of the solution and its impact on the IT.</p>

<p>Like any internet user, each time I see eXo Web OS and applications I am very very impressed. They have pushed very far the use of AJAX based applications to offer a complete virtualization of the OS/Desktop, not in a Virtual Machine, but simply in your favorite browser.</p>

<p><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aoQgQ1obiyE/SAxdf2YzmSI/AAAAAAAAADk/B9iAEMKI8yc/s320/webos001.png"></p>

<p>As you  can see in this screenshot, eXo is launching in your browser, a complete desktop, where I run many applications provided by eXo: Calendar, Forum, Mail, but a also a calculator gadget attached to the desktop itself. The easiest is to try the product, go to <a href="http://www.exoplatform.com/portal/public/en/quicktry">eXoplatform site and download it</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am just cross posting this entry to react to this very interesting article:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.developer.com/db/article.php/3735771">Exposing a Database as a Web Service</a> a developer.com article&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<h4>Oracle Application Server Web Services</h4>

<p>If you are an Oracle Application Server user, you may know that it is possible to expose database resources as Web Services using the OracleAS Web Services stack. You can for example using JAX-RPC based Web Service create service on a PL/SQL stored procedure, a SQL statement and even poste message on a queue (AQ). This is available in the Web Service Assembler (wsa) tool and also JDeveloper.</p>

<p>At the end when you have executed the wizard, you have a complete JavaEE application ready to be deloyed. All the JDBC calls and PL type mapping are done automatically by the wizard&hellip; very neat Take a look to the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B32110_01/web.1013/b28974/devdbase.htm#BDCCBHFG">Assembling Database Web Services</a> documentation.</p>

<p>Here the archtecture schema of OracleAS Database Web Services:</p>

<p><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aoQgQ1obiyE/R-ni1lmTTxI/AAAAAAAAADc/Os4eMkzOGXM/s320/aswsv009.gif"></p>

<p>It is important to mention that such service can leverage the WS-* support of OracleAS and any JAX-RPC handler you want to add to the service.</p>

<h4>BPEL PM and Database Resources</h4>

<p>In addition to a pure Java developer approach it is also possible to expose database resource as Web Service using Oracle BPEL PM, yeah&hellip; it could be overloaded, but still it is possible and very easy to do. See the chapter <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B31017_01/core.1013/b28764/bpel006.htm#CIHCIDGF">BPEL: Communicating with a Database</a></p>

<h4>Oracle RDBMS 11 NDWS</h4>

<p>Orale RDBMS introduced a new feature that is called: Native Oracle XML DB Web Services, that allows developer to directly expose Web Services from the DB. Take a look to the chapter <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/appdev.111/b28369/xdb_web_services.htm#ADXDB3900">Using Native Oracle XML DB Web Services</a>.</p>

<p>Note that in this case you do not have any WS-* support without another technical solution that could be Oracle Web Service Manager or any other solutions (such as a SOA appliance like for example IBM dataPower)</p>

<p>hmm I have not used that much this feature since I have left Oracle&hellip; I wonder when Oracle will provide a OS X release that will allow me to use my computer without any VM&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that I am back in consulting business, I often have customers where I am not allowed to connect my Mac on the network. Annoying!!!! But this is not a big issue since now it is easy to bring you environment on a USB key.</p>

<h4>XWi<em>key</em>: my wiki on a key</h4>

<p>On a daily business, I have installed my personal <a href="http://www.xwiki.com/">XWiki</a> on my 2Gb USB Key, and a JDK (for windows, on OSX I am using the default one). So with this solutions I have my personal CMS, Website and applications with me, and I can use it from any computer available. I work on any site, any meeting room directly on my Wiki even when I am not connected. I am using a packaged Entprise XWiki that comes with Jetty and HSQL, so it is a complete and self contained environment. I just changed the start and stop scripts to point to the JDK that is on the key. Nothing exceptional here, but it is very useful.</p>

<h4>Others portable applications</h4>

<p>I know that a Wiki is not enough most of the time to &ldquo; bring your life with you&rdquo;, and you may want more, such as Open Office, Mail and Web clients, &hellip; Some of the packages you can use:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://portableapps.com/">PortableApps</a> take a look to <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps">the list of applications</a> that are available in a portable fashion</li>
<li><a href="http://pendriveapps.com/">PenDriveApps</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.framakey.org/En/Index">Framakey</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The next test will be to run the OS from the key, I have not done it yet, have you? Some options for this:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/">PenDriveLinux</a></li>
<li><a href="http://flashlinux.org.uk/">FlashLinux</a></li>
</ul>
