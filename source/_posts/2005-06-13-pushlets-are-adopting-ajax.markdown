{% img http://www.pushlets.com/assets/pushlet-logo.gif %}Back in consulting I did some small projects using the [Pushlets framework](http://www.pushlets.com). A nice and simple solution to create easily Web eventing applications...

The Pushlet team has created a small demonstration of integration of Pushlet and XMLHttpRequest together...

If you never used Pushlets, take a look to it it is really nice!
