The JSR 223: Scripting for the Java Platform is now open for public review until March 28th.

If you are not familiar with it, the JSR 223 main goal is to define how the Java platform should integrate with scripting languages. It defines a standard API similar to [Bean Scripting Framework](http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/).

You can dowlnoad the spec from the [JCP Web Site](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223).
