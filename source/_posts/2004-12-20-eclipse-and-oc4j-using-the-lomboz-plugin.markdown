You can find a new [How-To Document](http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/java/oc4j/1013/howtos/how-to-configure-lomboz/doc/lomboz-howto-part-1.html) that explains how to use OC4J and Eclipse together using the Lomboz plugin.

You can download the server definition files for the Production release of OC4J 10g (9.0.4) or for the J2EE 1.4 Developer Preview 10.1.3.
