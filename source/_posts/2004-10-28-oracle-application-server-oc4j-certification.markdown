If you ask yourself on which Operating Systems, JDK, Browser, etc... you can use Oracle Application Server 10g just consult OTN or [Oracle Metalink](http://metalink.oracle.com/):

* [OTN Oracle Application Server 10g (9.0.4) Certification Matrix](http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/ias/files/as-certification-904.html)
