In this screencast I explain the support of multi-lingual content of eXo Platform 3.5. The different features that you can see in this video are:

*   Support of multiple languages from URL
*   Configure the eXo File Explorer to add support for multi-lingual content (new button)
*   Content translation
*   Add new language to the platform
