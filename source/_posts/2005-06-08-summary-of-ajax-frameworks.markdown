Michael Maheomff has published on [AjaxPatterns](http://www.ajaxpatterns.org) Web site an article that list existing Ajax frameworks. This [AJAXFrameworks article](http://www.ajaxpatterns.org/AJAXFrameworks) talks about server side solutions (Java, PHP, .Net, Lisp, Ruby, ....) and client side solutions that provided helpers around XMLHttpRequests and HTML programming.

Feel free to let some comments to Michael on its wiki if he has forgotten some... for example nothing about JavaServer Faces...
