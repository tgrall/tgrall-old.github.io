#### TLTR:
* MongoDB & Sage organized an internal Hackathon
* We use the new X3 Platform based on MongoDB, Node.js and HTML to add cool features  to the ERP
* This shows that “any” enterprise can do it to:
	* look differently at software development
	* build strong team spirit
	* have fun!


### Introduction

I have like many of you participated to multiple Hackathons, Startup Weekends where developers, designer and entrepreneurs are working together to build applications in few days. More and more companies are running such event internally, and this is what Alain and I have done last week with one of the MongoDB customer: Sage

In case you do not know Sage is a 30+ years old ERP vendor. I have to say that I could not imagine that coming from such company… Let me tell me more about it.

### MongoDB & Sage

In fact it is even cooler than only the Hackathon. I have met the development team few months back when I learned that Sage was using MongoDB. We discussed about use cases, architecture,... And this is when I was the most surprised! The new version of Sage ERP X3 is a mix of legacy components (RDBMS, C++ based proprietary middleware), and brand new layer based on Node.js, MongoDB and HTML (in fact an AngularJS like). The Sage team has open sourced some of the JS libraries, see https://github.com/sage Pretty cool isn’t?

### Sage Hackathon

Let’s go back, so when I met the team and saw what they have done, we discussed about the organization of a internal Hackathon to show the power of this new stack and have fun. And I was very happy to see that management and marketing were immediately excited about it.

As you can guess this is something totally new for such organization. So I worked with the Sage team, and we organize the event:

* Hackathon will be a 24 hours event (from noon to noon) like that Sage management can also organize corporate meetings before and after the event,
* Limited number of persons, 40 (6 teams), with a mix of developers, designer, product owner, quality engineer, … (coming from various countries),
* Define the teams with a mix of profiles,
* Define sample projects/ideas, to be sure each team has a project when we start,
* Find an external location to avoid *daily duty noice*

About the 2 last points, pre-assigned team, and list of existing ideas; it is true that it is quite different from the hackathon I have done, but it was important for us for many reasons:

* we have only 24h, so the teams must start to develop the feature immediately
* we need to be sure teams have all the skills needed to implement these ideas.

Also, the Sage X3 team, organized internal Web conferences to talk about this event, talked about the various ideas, and asked people for new ideas. And many news ideas were added to the list!

The goal of the hackathon was simple: **build cool features that extend the ERP X3**

#### Let’s code !

The event was organized in a very nice location, [Les Fontaines](http://www.les-fontaines.com/), with coffee, redbull, food, ...

All projects were quickly presented:

* Twitter Sentiment Analysis in relation with the ERP Product Catalog
* LinkedIn integration to manage HR skills
* Caching layer
* Notifications
* Discussion/Comments
* Spreadsheet Integration

All the teams started to draw things on whiteboards, asked questions about Sage Javascript library, MongoDB (especially document design), ...






### So what?









So last week we, 40 people met in a very nice location, Les Fontaines, to hack for 24h.



Last week I spend 2 days with Sage, a MongoDB partner, to participate to their first internal hackathon: it was “funtastic”!

Let me go back a little. You may have seen last September that Sage is using MongoDB is their “ERP X3” product. In fact the new release of X3 is using many interesting technologies such has node.js, mongodb, and “AngularJS” like client to integrate their legacy code (C++ middleware & RDBMS) with their new 100% Web based/REST oriented application.

I have to say that I was really impressed when I started to work with the Sage development team, and see how cool is the new architecture; and how it could be used to extend the platform. We decided together to organize an Hackathon involving the whole product development team (developers, architects, designer, product owner, ...).

The main goal:
bring the team together
show a new way of developing (agile!)
deep dive into the technology
open new possibles!

What I take from this experience?

I have participated to many hackathons “public ones for startups”, but this is the first one that I am involved in an internal event,
