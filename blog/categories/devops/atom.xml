    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow! it has been a while since I posted something on my blog post. I have been very busy, moving to MongoDB, learning, learning, learning…finally I can breath a little and answer some questions.</p>

<p>Last week I have been helping my colleague Norberto to deliver a MongoDB Essentials Training in Paris. This was a very nice experience, and I am impatient to deliver it on my own. I was happy to see that the audience was well balanced between developers and operations, mostly DBA.</p>

<h3>What! I still need DBA?</h3>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://ct.fra.bz/ol/fz/sw/i53/5/6/8/frabz-what-if-i-told-you-you-dont-need-to-know-sql-to-be-a-dba-85380e.jpg">http://ct.fra.bz/ol/fz/sw/i53/5/6/8/frabz-what-if-i-told-you-you-dont-need-to-know-sql-to-be-a-dba-85380e.jpg</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>This is a good opportunity to raise a point, or comment a wrong idea: the fact that you are using MongoDB, or any other NoSQL datastore does not mean that you do not need a DBA… Like any project, an administrator is not mandatory, but if you have one it is better. So even when MongoDB is pushed by development team it is very important to understand the way the database works, and how to administer, monitor it.</p>

<p>If you are lucky enough to have real operations teams, with good system and database administrators use them! They are very important for your application.</p>

<p>Most DBA/System Administrators have been maintaining systems in production for many years. They know how to keep your application up and running. They also most of the time experienced many “disasters”, and then recover (I hope).</p>

<p>Who knows, you may encounter big issues with your application and you will be happy to have them on your side at this moment.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;Great, but the DBA is slowing down my development!&rdquo;</h3>

<p>I hear this, sometimes, and I had this feeling in the past to as developer in large organization. Is it true?</p>

<p>Developers and DBA are today, not living in the same worlds:</p>

<ul>
<li>Developers want to integrate new technologies as soon as possible, not only because it is fun and they can brag about it during meetups/conferences; but because these technologies, most of the time, are making them more productive, and offer better service/experience to the consumer</li>
<li>DBA, are here to keep the applications up and running! So every time they do not feel confident about a technology they will push back. I think this is natural and I would be probably the same in their position. Like all geeks, they would love to adopt new technologies but they need to understand and trust it before.</li>
</ul>


<p>System administrators, DBAS look at the technology with a different angle than developers.</p>

<p>Based on this assumption, it is important to bring the operation team as early as possible when  the development team wants to integrate MongoDB or any new data store. Having the operation team in the loop early will ease the global adoption of MongoDB in the company.</p>

<p>Personally, and this will show my age, I have seen a big change in the way developers and DBAs are working together.</p>

<p>Back in the 90&rsquo;s, when the main architecture was based on client/server architecture  developers and DBAs where working pretty well togethers; probably because they were speaking the same language: SQL was everywhere.  I had regular meetings wit</p>

<p>Then, since mid 2000, mots of applications have moved to a web based architecture , with for example Java middleware, and the developers stopped working with DBAs. Probably because the abstraction data layer provided by the ORM exposed the database as a &ldquo;commodity&rdquo; service that is supposed to work: &ldquo;Hey Mr DBA, my application has been written with the best middleware technology on the market, so now deal with the performance and scalability! I am done!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes it is a cliché, but I am sure that some of you will recognize that.</p>

<p>Nevertheless each time I can, I have been pushing developers to talk more to administrators and look closely to their database!</p>

<h3>A new era for operations and development teams</h3>

<p>The fast adoption of MongoDB by developers, is a great opportunity to fix what we have broken 10 years ago in large information systems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s talk again!</li>
</ul>


<p>MongoDB has been built first for developers. The document oriented approach gives lot of flexibility to quickly adapt to change. So anytime your business users need a new feature you can implement it, even if this change impact the data structure. Your data model is now driven and controlled by the application, not the database engine.</p>

<p>However, the applications still need to be available 24x7, and performs well. These topics are managed - and shared- by administrator and developers! This has been always the case but, as I described it earlier, it looks like some of us have forgotten that.</p>

<p>Schemas design, change velocity, are driven by the application, so the business and development teams, but all this impacts the database, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>How storage will grow ?</li>
<li>Which indexes must be created to speed up my application?</li>
<li>How to organize my cluster to leverage the infrastructure properly:

<ul>
<li>Replica-Set organization (and related write concerns, managed by developer)</li>
<li>Sharding options</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And the most important of them : backup/recovery strategies</li>
</ul>


<p>So many things that could be managed by the project team, but if you have an operation team with you, it will be better to do that as a single team.</p>

<p>You, the developer, are convinced that MongoDB is the best database for your projects! Now it is time to work with the ops team and convince them too.  So you should for sure explain why MongoDB is good for you as developer, but also you should highlight all the benefits for the operations, starting with built-in high-availability with replica sets, and easy scalability with sharding. MongoDB is also here to make the life of the administrator easier! I have shared in the next paragraph a lit of resources that are interesting for operations people.</p>

<p>Let’s repeat it another time, try to involve the operation team as soon as possible, and use that as an opportunity to build/rebuild the relationship between developers and system administrators!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Look at the Couchbase Ansible Playbook on my <a href="https://github.com/tgrall/couchbase-ansible-playbook">Github</a>.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>When I was looking for a more effective way to create my cluster I asked some sysadmins which tools I should use to do it. The answer I got during <a href="http://www.netways.de/osdc">OSDC</a> was not <a href="https://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a>, nor <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a>, but was <a href="http://ansible.cc/">Ansible</a>.</p>

<p>This article shows you how you can easily configure and create a Couchbase cluster deployed and many linux boxes&hellip;and the only thing you need on these boxes is an SSH Server!</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://jpmens.net/">Jan-Piet Mens</a> that was one of the person that convinced me to use Ansible and answered questions I had about Ansible.</p>

<p>You can watch the demonstration below, and/or look at all the details in the next paragraph.</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="420" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/COb6y89xcYY?color=white&theme=light"></iframe></p>

<h3>Ansible</h3>

<h4>Ansible is an open-source software that allows administrator to configure and manage many computers over SSH.</h4>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go in all the details about the installation, just follow the steps documented in the <a href="http://ansible.cc/docs/gettingstarted.html">Getting Started Guide</a>. As you can see from this guide, you just need Python and few other libraries and clone Ansible project from Github. So I am expecting that you have Ansible working with your various servers on which you want to deploy Couchbase.</p>

<p>Also for this first scripts I am using <strong>root</strong> on my server to do all the operations. So be sure you have register the root ssh keys to your administration server, from where you are running the Ansible scripts.</p>

<h3>Create a Couchbase Cluster</h3>

<p>So before going into the details of the Ansible script it is interesting to explain how you create a Couchbase Cluster. So here are the 5 steps to create and configure a cluster:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install Couchbase on each nodes of the cluster, as documented <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.0/couchbase-getting-started-install-ubuntu.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>Take one of the node and &ldquo;initialize&rdquo; the cluster,  using <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.0/couchbase-cli-other-examples.html">cluster-init command</a>.</li>
<li>Add the other nodes to the cluster, using <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.0/couchbase-cli-other-examples.html">server-add command</a>.</li>
<li>Rebalance, using <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.0/couchbase-cli-other-examples.html">rebalance command</a>.</li>
<li>Create a Bucket, using <a href="http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.0/couchbase-cli-other-examples.html">bucket-create command</a>.</li>
</ol>


<p>So the goal now is to create an Ansible Playbook that does these steps for you.</p>

<h4>Ansible Playbook for Couchbase</h4>

<p>The first think you need is to have the list of hosts you want to target, so I have create a <a href="https://github.com/tgrall/couchbase-ansible-playbook/blob/master/hosts">hosts file</a> that contains all my server organized in 2 groups:</p>

<pre><code>[couchbase-main]
vm1.grallandco.com

[couchbase-nodes]
vm2.grallandco.com
vm3.grallandco.com
</code></pre>

<p>The group [couchbase-main] group is just one of the node that will drive the installation and configuration, as you probably already know, Couchbase does not have any master&hellip; All nodes in the cluster are identical.</p>

<p>To ease the configuration of the cluster, I have create another file that contains all parameters that must be sent to all the various commands. This file is located in the <a href="https://github.com/tgrall/couchbase-ansible-playbook/blob/master/group_vars/all">group_vars/all</a> see the section <a href="http://ansible.cc/docs/patterns.html#splitting-out-host-and-group-specific-data">Splitting Out Host and Group Specific Data</a> in the documentation.</p>

<pre><code># Adminisrator user and password
admin_user: Administrator
admin_password: password

# ram quota for the cluster
cluster_ram_quota: 1024

# bucket and replicas
bucket_name: ansible
bucket_ram_quota: 512
num_replicas: 2
</code></pre>

<p>Use this file to configure your cluster.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s describe the <a href="https://github.com/tgrall/couchbase-ansible-playbook/blob/master/couchbase.yml">playbook file</a> :</p>

<pre><code>- name: Couchbase Installation
hosts: all
user: root

tasks:

- name: download Couchbase package
get_url: url=http://packages.couchbase.com/releases/2.0.1/couchbase-server-enterprise_x86_64_2.0.1.deb dest=~/.

- name: Install dependencies
apt: pkg=libssl0.9.8 state=present

- name: Install Couchbase .deb file on all machines
shell: dpkg -i ~/couchbase-server-enterprise_x86_64_2.0.1.deb
</code></pre>

<p>As expected, the installation has to be done on <strong>all</strong> servers as <strong>root</strong> then we need to execute 3 tasks:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the product, the get_url command will only download the file if not already present</li>
<li>Install the dependencies with the apt command, the state=present allows the system to only install this package if not already present</li>
<li>Install Couchbase with a simple shell command. (here I am not checking if Couchbase is already installed)</li>
</ol>


<p>So we have now installed Couchbase on all the nodes. Let&rsquo;s now configure the first node and add the others:</p>

<pre><code>- name: Initialize the cluster and add the nodes to the cluster
hosts: couchbase-main
user: root

tasks:
- name: Configure main node
shell: /opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli cluster-init -c 127.0.0.1:8091  --cluster-init-username=${admin_user} --cluster-init-password=${admin_password} --cluster-init-port=8091 --cluster-init-ramsize=${cluster_ram_quota}

- name: Create shell script for configuring main node
action: template src=couchbase-add-node.j2 dest=/tmp/addnodes.sh mode=750

- name: Launch config script
action: shell /tmp/addnodes.sh

- name: Rebalance the cluster
shell: /opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli rebalance -c 127.0.0.1:8091 -u ${admin_user} -p ${admin_password}

- name: create bucket ${bucket_name} with ${num_replicas} replicas
shell: /opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli bucket-create -c 127.0.0.1:8091 --bucket=${bucket_name} --bucket-type=couchbase --bucket-port=11211 --bucket-ramsize=${bucket_ram_quota}  --bucket-replica=${num_replicas} -u ${admin_user} -p ${admin_password}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we need to execute specific taks on the &ldquo;main&rdquo; server:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initialization of the cluster using the Couchbase CLI, on line 06 and 07</li>
</ul>


<p>Then the system needs to ask all other server to join the cluster. For this the system needs to get the various IP and for each IP address execute the add-server command with the IP address. As far as I know it is not possible to get the IP address from the main playbook YAML file, so I ask the system to generate a shell script to add each node and execute the script.</p>

<p>This is done from the line 09 to 13.</p>

<p>To generate the shell script, I use <a href="http://ansible.cc/docs/modules.html#template">Ansible Template</a>, the template is available in the <a href="https://github.com/tgrall/couchbase-ansible-playbook/blob/master/couchbase-add-node.j2">couchbase-add-node.j2</a> file.</p>

<pre><code>
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see this script loop on each server in the [couchbase-nodes] group and use its IP address to add the node to the cluster.</p>

<p>Finally the script rebalance the cluster (line 16) and add a new bucket (line 19).</p>

<p>You are now ready to execute the playbook using the following command :</p>

<pre><code>./bin/ansible-playbook -i ./couchbase/hosts ./couchbase/couchbase.yml -vv
</code></pre>

<p>I am adding the -vv parameter to allow you to see more information about what&rsquo;s happening during the execution of the script.</p>

<p>This will execute all the commands described in the playbook, and after few seconds you will have a new cluster ready to be used! You can for example open a browser and go to the Couchase Administration Console and check that your cluster is configured as expected.</p>

<p> <img class="<a" src="href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L-3yeJZECwY/Uaj_PA_aVUI/AAAAAAAAAcg/fKBZ47Nhd4M/s320/Screen+Shot+2013-05-31+at+9.50.44+PM.png">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L-3yeJZECwY/Uaj_PA_aVUI/AAAAAAAAAcg/fKBZ47Nhd4M/s320/Screen+Shot+2013-05-31+at+9.50.44+PM.png</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>As you can see it is really easy and fast to create a new cluster using Ansible.</p>

<p>I have also create a script to uninstall properly the cluster.. just launch</p>

<pre><code>./bin/ansible-playbook -i ./couchbase/hosts ./couchbase/couchbase-uninstall.yml
</code></pre>
