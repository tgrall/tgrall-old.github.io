    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With XML and SOA becoming mainstream in the enterprise XML operation such as Schema validations, XSL transformations are now very common. These specific operations are CPU intensive and could become a performance bottleneck when directly applied on the middleware. It could be even worst now when using SOAP based Web Services and their related WS-* standards. For example with WS-Security, XML encryption and signature is now more and more used in SOA based applications.</p>

<p>This is why many enterprise architects are bow looking for solutions to improve performances of XML centric applications.</p>

<p>One of the think we learn when developing application, and that Aspect Oriented Programming has highlighted is the concept of “separation of concerns”. It is key to keep that in mind also in global architecture in our case by separating the XML processing from the business logic. Hopefully it is most of the time done directly by the various Web Services framework you are using, you do not code the SOAP request/response, it is hidden by the Web Services framework.</p>

<p>However, in the current application server, the full XML treatment is made directly in the container, for example the XML Encryption is made in the same container that the place where the pure business logic is executed. So let’s find a solution to extract the most intensive XML processing into another part of the system.</p>

<p>Vendors have now in their catalog appliances that could do the job. The same way that today we are using SSL accelerators to deal with SSL encryption/decryption, we can put XML appliance to deal with the intensive CPU processing operation: XML validations, transformation, Ws-Security enforcing point,&hellip;</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Architecture Overview</h3>

<p>The overall architecture could be represented using the following schema :</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_aoQgQ1obiyE/R11pWKMLwEI/AAAAAAAAACU/Bvo623h0JCA/s400/soa-appliance.png">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_aoQgQ1obiyE/R11pWKMLwEI/AAAAAAAAACU/Bvo623h0JCA/s400/soa-appliance.png</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>The role of the XML/SOA Appliance varies a lot depending of your project:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Simple XML firewall</em> to check the validity of the XML/SOAP messages</li>
<li><em>Web Services access control</em>: lookup enterprise directory to check authentication and authorization. This could be based on the WS-Security standards and its various tokens (username, SAML, &hellip;)</li>
<li><em>Content generation and transformation</em>: the appliance can be used to serve various devices for example WAP cell phone or simple HTML Web Client. the XSL transformation is done in a very efficient way in the appliance directly.</li>
<li><em>Services Virtualization</em> : it is possible to route the different messages to various end point depending of simple rules. (business or IT system rules)</li>
</ul>


<p>As you can see from an architecture point of view, XML appliances are very interesting to distribute the heavy processing of XML to some specific hardware. I have noticed that sometimes developers/architects hesitate to put another piece of hardware/software in their design, but I do think that in this specific case it is probably a good move.</p>

<p>Separating the concern is quite easy and very clean when dealing with XML processing, but also it will allow the overall architecture to be managed in a better way. This kind of appliance will allow administrators to centralize the management of policies, and transformations. But also a side effect of this is the simple fact that when dealing with Web Services, you can easily add WS-* support to many stacks that do not support &ldquo;them&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>XML/SOA Appliances Offering</h3>

<p>I have said earlier that vendors are offering such products, here some of the product that I have met or pushed:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/datapower/">IBM DataPower</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bee-ware.net/en/product/i-sentry/">Bee Ware i-Sentry</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.vordel.com/products/">Vordel</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.layer7tech.com/">Layer 7 XML Appliances</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>What&rsquo;s next?</h3>

<p>Some of you would probably raise the fact that the application server, especially when dealing with Web Services, must parse the XML/SOAP request even if this has been done by the appliance. Yes it is true, but I am sure that in a next future the vendors of such solution would optimize it by providing for example support for binary XML, or any other solution that will improve even more the performance of the overall IT in complex enterprise architecture. But for this application server must support binary XML first to avoid proprietary approaches.</p>

<p>Another point of view that I have not talk about is the possible support of such appliance around Web 2.0/Ajax optimization. I have not yet dive into this, but I am sure we can do very interesting things too.</p>

<p>Finally if you have experiences with any XML/SOA appliance feel free to post a comment about it, it will help the readers to see the interest (or not) around this topic.</p>

    <link href="http://tgrall.github.io/blog/2007/10/07/paris-soa-forum-feedback-and-little-comments-about-soa-projects/"/>

    <id>http://tgrall.github.io/blog/2007/10/07/paris-soa-forum-feedback-and-little-comments-about-soa-projects</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week I have attended a SOA conference in Paris the <a href="http://forumsoa.fr/">SOA Forum</a>. (I was not there in 2006). This event is not a technical event targeted towards developers but mainly oriented for IT managers and decision makers. This day was well attended, around 200 people. The content and more important the questions and round tables provide a good snapshot of how SOA is adopted.</p>

<p>If last year, based on comments that I can get, the message was &ldquo;<em>What &amp; Why SOA?</em>&rdquo; this year I have the feeling that most of the audience was really familiarized with the SOA concepts -as I said earlier it is not a technical conference- and now they are more asking &ldquo;<em>How and When SOA?</em>&rdquo;. Lot of discussions were about how to I start the projects, since in many case the SOA will impact the whole IT, and even more the full enterprise.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><strong>Thoughts about SOA project &amp; approach</strong></p>

<p>It is hard to say if the best way to start with SOA is starting from the Top (C level) or from the IT department on a departmental project. To be honest I think it will depend of each organizations; and depends of &ldquo;why&rdquo; SOA is a good fit for the enterprise.</p>

<p>I am tempted to say that if the choice is made for a &ldquo;Time-To-Market&rdquo; reason I believe that the project will start from a specific business need and be implemented in a &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; fashion., meaning the IT will quickly put together some services to give some agility to the business. This is something that I have seen many times in the telco industry.</p>

<p>At the other end, when the key factor is about rationalization of the business processes over the whole enterprise, the project is often manage at the IT management level if not even higher. This because this kind of approach will have impact on many departments/people.</p>

<p>Basically like in any project it is important to have:</p>

<ul>
<li>good communication between actors that could be developers or departments</li>
<li>share the same goals</li>
<li>have an understanding of the technologies that will be used and their constraints.If for the point 1 &amp; 2 this is management that deals with this. For the 3rd one, we are closer to the technology where we can probably share the most -saying that because I believe that most of you, reader, are technical people. At the end of the day we do not build system with slideshows, but with products/solutions. So it is part of our job to take time to understand the pros/cons, limitations of the different products that will be involved in the project.</li>
</ul>


<p>One example, is this week I have visited a customer and this customer wants to put in place an ESB to provide services to the different departments of the enterprise. Discussing at the global level of the architecture we all agreed on the different needs such as: connectivity to heterogeneous systems, transformation, routing, &hellip;</p>

<p>Then the customer talk about &ldquo;Web Services&rdquo; again and again, this is where I have to say, I always try to slow down the discussion to set the expectation at the correct level, for example talking about impact on reliability, security of the HTTP/SOAP based Web Services. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong I am not saying that it is not possible to achieve correct QoS (Quality of Services) with Web Services but it could have an impact on the product choice, for example supporting WS-RM, WS-Security or even using proprietary approach for stateful Web Services, &hellip; And the same comments, questions could occur with other part of the stack.</p>

<p>In conclusion, independently of the type of approach you are taking to put in place a Service Oriented Architecture, you will need sometimes to really understand well the product/solution you will be using to implement it. And for each of the options you will be choosing take some time to estimate the pros/cons and limitations of it. The same way you are taking time to list the different services, their granularity,  their QoS, you need to take some time to analyze the different solution. For example when you choose to use an ESB, BPEL engine with their connectivity capabilities, what are the best way to connect to a system (SOAP, JMS, JDBC, JCA, Java, ..), how to code the logic (Java, BPEL, business rules, &hellip;) and for each of this question think about the impact of it on your system. For example, how portable will be my code/business process, and is it important for me?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was helping a customer with his BPEL in cluster and we needed to follow the flow and on which machine the instance was running.</p>

<p>I simply use a <code>bpel:exec</code> activity with the following code:</p>

<pre><code class="java">java.net.InetAddress addr = null;

try {
  addr = java.net.InetAddress.getLocalHost();
}
catch (Exception e) {
  System.out.println("EXCEPTION :"+ e);
}
setVariableData("HostNameVariable", addr.getCanonicalHostName());
</code></pre>

<p>This code is just an example of what could be done. Here I am using java.net code API and put the result in a BPEL global variable using the <span style="font-family:monospace;"></span>setVariableData method. Obviously you will use appropriate code to differenciate the different nodes for example the name of the OC4J instance, hostname, &hellip; or any interesting value.</p>

    <link href="http://tgrall.github.io/blog/2006/04/23/oracle-bpel-debugging-internal-soap-messages/"/>
    <updated>2006-04-23T21:35:38+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://tgrall.github.io/blog/2006/04/23/oracle-bpel-debugging-internal-soap-messages</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you develop applications
that use SOAP based Web Services you very often use an HTTP proxy to
capture the request and response that are exchanged between the clients
and servers. For this you can use the Oracle HTTP Analyzer that is part
of the toolset of Oracle JDeveloper, Axis TCP Monitor, or a packaged
version of it that you have with Oracle BPEL Process Manager.</p>

<p>BPELs are making extensive usage of SOAP messages, and it could be
interesting to debug the different call to the partnerlinks. Oracle
BPEL PM, to avoid HTTP calls and make optimized SOAP message when the
partnerlink that you are invoking is deployed as a BPEL. So in the
default configuration you do not see the different calls. In this
article I explain how you can configure the server to be able to do it.</p>

<p>For this I will be using:</p>

<ul>
<li>Oracle BPEL Process Manager developer install running in an OC4J 10g Stand Alone (10.1.2.0.2)</li>
<li>obtunnel, that is a package version of Axis TCP Monitor located in <code>&amp;lt;BPEL_HOME&amp;gt;\bin\obtunnel.bat</code></li>
<li>LoanFlow demo that you can install in 2 steps:</li>
</ul>


<h4>Starting the Oralce BPEL Tunneling tool:</h4>

<p>Just run the command <code>&amp;lt;BPEL_HOME&amp;gt;\bin\obtunnel.bat</code> You will see the following application:</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://static.flickr.com/46/133968437_aa0d5804f6_o.png">http://static.flickr.com/46/133968437_aa0d5804f6_o.png</a>&#8221;></p>

<p>By default the TCPMonitor launched from BPEL listens on the port 1234
and proxies for the default Oracle BPEL port 9700. So in this context
you will capture all the requests is you access the server on the port
1234.</p>

<p>It is not sufficiant here since the different partnerlinks endpoint are
not dynamique and are set to the port 9700. So in this case you wont&rsquo;s
see the request coming from the BPEL to a local partner link (and I am
  not talking about the SOAP Optimization yet).</p>

<p>One way that I use to work around this issue in development &ndash;<span style="font-style: italic;">may be we have more simple
  solutions, but this is the one that I use</span>&ndash; is to change
  the port of the OC4J and make the proxy listening on the port 9700. In
  this case you will be able to capture the requests made from BPEL to
  its partnerlinks.</p>

<h4>Changing the Port of OC4J and the TCP Monitor</h4>

<p><em>I. Change the HTTP port of OC4J used by BPEL</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Open <code>&amp;lt;BPEL_HOME&amp;gt;\system\appserver\oc4j\j2ee\home\config\http-web-site.xml</code></li>
<li>Edit the <code>port</code> attribute of the root element <code>web-site</code> to enter a different value</li>
</ol>


<p>eg: <code>&amp;lt;web-site port="9701"...</code>.  Stop your BPEL Process Manager</p>

<p><em>II. Start a new TCPMonitor on port 9700</em></p>

<ol>
<li>In the TCPMonitor sceen click on the Admin Tab</li>
<li>Enter 9700 for the &ldquo;Listen Port #&rdquo; field (since we want to be sure the partnerlinks are called correctly)</li>
<li>Enter 9701 (or the value you entered for the HTTP port) for &ldquo;Target Port #&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Click Add</li>
<li>Click on the new tab &ldquo;Port 9700&rdquo;. If you have an error message like &ldquo;<em>java.net.BindException: Address Already in use: JVM_Bind</em>&rdquo; this is simply because your BPEL process manager is not stopped. In this case stop the BPEL server, and start the TCPMonitor by clicking the Start button.</li>
</ol>


<p><em>III. Restart you BPEL Server</em></p>

<p>Nothing special here you just need to start your server, and check that the BPEL PM is now listening on the HTTP port that you have entered, in my case 9701:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>http://localhost:9701/BPELConsole</code></li>
</ul>


<p>You can now go on the test page of the LoanFlow process (either on the port 9700 or 9701) and invoke the process. I am using 9701 since I want to capture the calls make by the Business Process to its partnerlinks.</p>

<p>You can see some HTTP activities in your TCPMonitor, but if you look in
        details you only see request to the different WSDLs used by the
        LoanFlow&hellip;</p>

<p>I was like you expecting to be able to see the different SOAP requests
        and response, but BPEL does some optimization around local SOAP calls.
        So to be able to capture these requests you just need to turn of this
        optimization.</p>

<h4>Turning Off the SOAP Shortcut</h4>

<ol>
<li>In the BPEL console, click on the &ldquo;<em>Manage BPEL Domain</em>&rdquo; link (topright)</li>
<li>You arrive in the configuration tab, look for the <code>optSoapShortcut</code> property and set it to <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>Click <code>Apply</code> You can now go on the test page of the LoanFlow process (either on the port 9700 or 9701) and invoke the process. I am using 9701 since I want to capture the calls make by the Business Process to its partnerlinks.</li>
</ol>


<p>Now you can see all the SOAP requests and responses between the LoanFlow BPEL and its partnerlinks.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://static.flickr.com/46/133968438_d0dc761af0.jpg?v=0">http://static.flickr.com/46/133968438_d0dc761af0.jpg?v=0</a>&#8221;></p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://static.flickr.com/46/133968438_d0dc761af0_o.png">http://static.flickr.com/46/133968438_d0dc761af0_o.png</a>&#8221;></p>

<p><em>Update on 08/02/2007</em></p>

<p>For people that are currently using <strong>Oracle BPEL 10.1.3.1</strong> the <em>optSoapShortcut</em> is not visible anymore in the console, but it is still possible to configure this by adding it manually in the domain configuration file available at:</p>

<p><code>$BPEL_HOME/domains/&lt;domain&gt;/config/domain.xml</code></p>

    <link href="http://tgrall.github.io/blog/2005/10/20/can-i-do-soa-with-web-services-today/"/>
    <updated>2005-10-20T21:20:14+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://tgrall.github.io/blog/2005/10/20/can-i-do-soa-with-web-services-today</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am just coming back for Toronto where I have been presenting Oracle
Developer Day: SOA for J2EE Developers. As part of this exercise I have
introduced Web Services and related technologies/standards.</p>

<p>A person in the audience asked me:</p>

<blockquote><p>But can I do SOA Today?
Are Web Services are mature enough?</p></blockquote>

<p>I think that is a very interesting and valid question. The answer is
certainly:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Yes you can, and I would add, yes you should!!</em></li>
</ul>


<p>Web Services are &nbsp;definitively big actors in Service Oriented
Architecture since by definition they are loosely coupled,
implementation agnostic and facilitate reusability. In the same time
the concern of this person are justified since some important pieces of
infrastructure are yet available in vendors solutions. Or if they exist
they are proprietary and won&rsquo;t allow interoperability of the service
with other stack&hellip; Losing interoperability is a big deal when you talk
about Web Services since most of the time, if the designers want to use
Web Services it is to be able to reuse it in various applications,
independently of the platform where this application is running.</p>

<h4>Why I have answered Yes?</h4>

<!-- more -->


<p>Why I am so positive when I answered this person? Just simply because
Web Services are today mature enough. But like any development of
applications/systems the development should start with a clear
definition of the requirements. When the development team will start to
write down the requirement it will be clear of not what are the
important pieces in term of services. Beside the business requirements,
lots of requirements are technical/IT related such as security,
performance, manageability, reliability, and transaction management,
performance&hellip; So when you design your system do not forgot to clarify
what are the different infrastructure services you need&hellip;.</p>

<p>It is then easy to match your infrastructure requirement list to the
different quality of services supported by the platform you will
implementing on, and as important, the platform(s) you will have to
integrate with.&nbsp; For example today it is possible to easily
create SOA/Web Services application that are secured because
WS-Security is a standard supported by most of the vendors. At the
opposite it may be very challenging to create SOA/WS based application
that involve a very complex transaction model with various applications
and system since no standard have been implemented in a real
interoperable manner. But no worry the WS brains are here and work on
it, take some time to read more about WS-Transactions and other related
standardization effort.</p>

<p>Based on the previous example with security and transaction, it is also
important to keep in mind that the Web Services is a mature technology
but it is still evolving -based on real life requirements-. So in the
same time your application/system will evolve -it is one of your goal
when you do SOA, it is to build a more agile system that can react to
business, or technological changes quicker-, do not forget that your
vendor are continuously working to not only define the standard but
also implement them in their product. So you may put as a requirement
from the beginning a specific infrastructure services that are not
available in today&rsquo;s product but the important question to ask you
before dropping SOA/Web Service is when I really need this feature?
When this feature will be available in my platform?</p>

<p>This is why also it is important to understand the strategy of your
vendor in term of flexibility and adaptability of their solution to the
different standards, and how it can help you to take care of legacy
services that need to integrate with your new applications. One nice
example is the usage of Oracle Web Services Manager. Even if
WS-Security is one of the first standard around &ldquo;Enterprise Web
Services&rdquo; it has not been in the different stack for long so lot of
existing WS do not support WS-Sec. Oracle Web Services Manager allow
you using agents and/or gateway to add security in a standard way to
existing services, and enrich you SOA with a better quality of
services.&nbsp; So do not say no to SOA/SOA because a standard does
not exist or exist but not implemented, it will come -take a look to
all the WS-* effort-, and this standards will be able to extend the
system that you are building as you need&hellip;. SOA is all about agility,
to be sure that it will be agile enough to provide you more services as
you go!</p>
