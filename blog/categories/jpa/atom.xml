    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oracle has announced yesterday during  <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/">EclipseCon</a> in Santa Clara (California) that it <em>open-sources</em> Oracle Toplink as part of the Eclipse Project.</p>

<p>The idea is to open source all the features of Toplink (ORM/JPA, OXM/JAXB, and EIS support), but also features that are currently under development and will be part of the Eclipse project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Service Data Objects (SDO) implementation and SDO Data Access Service (DAS) that leverages JPA for use with SDO.*   XR (XML-Relational) that provides a completely metadata driven approach to obtaining relational data as XML.</li>
<li>DBWS which exposes XR as a web service. With DBWS, you can easily build web services that access relational data without any programming.</li>
</ul>


<p>One part will be kept by Oracle, this is the &ldquo;glue&rdquo; code that is used for the integration with OracleAS that is probably not useful for anybody but Oracle.
For details check out the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/corporate/press/2007_mar/OpenSource-TopLink.html">press release</a> and the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/eclipse/pdf/eclipselink-faq.pdf">FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>If you are at EclipseCon do not hesitate to visit the Oracle booth to learn more about this great news for the Java developers.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mike Keith, Oracle Toplink architect, persistence guru, and member of the EJB 3.0 Expert Group, gives an, <a href="http://www.jroller.com/comments/mkeith/Weblog/the_ejb_3_0_hibernate">in his last entry</a> an overview of EJB 3.0, in the context of the comparison with Hibernate and especially explaining why the statement that we sometimes hear &ldquo;EJB 3.0 <em>is</em> Hibernate&rdquo; is  wrong.</p>

<p>This blog entry as been selected as a news by The Server Side, titled &ldquo;<a href="http://theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=33450">EJB 3.0 <strong>is not</strong> Hibernate</a>&rdquo; and is very active in term of comments/reaction, feel free to add yours there.</p>

<p>In the same time if you want to learn more about EJB 3.0 and start developing with it you can find infromation and EJB 3.0 container on <a href="http://otn.oracle.com/ejb3">OTN</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Raghu just posted an interesting article asking the question &ldquo;<a href="http://www.jroller.com/comments/raghukodali/Weblog/does_ejb_3_0_really">Does EJB 3.0 really make application development easy?</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So as you will see EJB 3.0 does simplify the development by reducing the number of source and descriptor files that you have to manipulate. (I won&rsquo;t go in the detail of the number of lines of Java or XML). What I really like about EJB 3.0 is not only the fact that Entity bean are POJOs, but also that now you can read the code and understand how the application is build, thanks to the annotations! I am sure that if you got the EJB 2.x genes you do not find them complex, but I did not have this mutation&hellip;</p>

<p>I am inviting you to download the <a href="http://otn.oracle.com/ejb3">Oracle EJB 3.0 Developer Preview</a> to be more familiar with this technology.</p>
