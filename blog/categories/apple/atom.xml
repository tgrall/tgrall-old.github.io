    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey Steve, keep the bean in the Apple!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/10/apple-deprecates-java">news from last week</a> that grabbed the attention of many Java developers was Apple’s announcement of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#releasenotes/Java/JavaSnowLeopardUpdate3LeopardUpdate8RN/Introduction/Introduction.html">its intentions to deprecate Java in the latest OS X 10.6 update</a>. One sentence stood out in particular, “Developers should not rely on the Apple-supplied Java runtime being present in future versions of Mac OS X,” and raised the question: should Java developers (many of whom, like me, develop on Macs) freak out?</p>

<p>I don’t think so. (Though it prompted additional speculation and <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/10/26/java-is-under-siege-will-oracle-let-it-burn/">follow-on news stories</a>.)</p>

<p>Let’s be realistic. Most applications run on the server side, on Unix/Linux and/or Windows Server – which has nothing to do with Apple or Mac OS X. And more and more applications are running on the cloud, where the language isn’t necessarily irrelevant, but certainly less important than the services that the application exposes. And I’m sure Java will have a big role in ‘development in the cloud,’ as we can already see with Google AppEngine and the VMWare/SpringSource effort.</p>

<p>I think the more interesting question to ask is “Why did Apple do this?”</p>

<p>I believe this is related Apple’s other big news last week: the new “Mac App Store,” which looks like an effort to have one single technology and language to develop “official” applications for Mac. In fact, for all Apple platforms running OS X and iOS, developers should use X Code and Objective C. That’s fine with me, as I enjoy developing small apps for my iPhone and iPad in my spare time, using these tools. But at eXo, many of our developers are using Java, often on Macs, to build our software.</p>

<p>We’re not talking about the same kind of applications. If, in the future, Java does not exist on Macs, it will not cause enterprise developers to abandon Java, but simply force them to move away from their Macs. Personally, I don’t want that to happen. I switched to Mac in 2001, and I’ve been a big fan of all Apple products ever since (most of my extended family are now also on Macs, and they couldn’t care less about Java).</p>

<p>As a Java developer, do I switch back to PC now? Unlikely. I am very confident (overconfident?) that Java will still be present on OS X. The difference is that Apple will simply stop caring about it &ndash; the same way that Microsoft doesn’t care now. I cannot believe that Apple will stop/block Java on their platform. So the future of Java in general, and now on Mac, is fully under the control of the Java community, driven by Oracle and OpenJDK.  I am sure we will find many skilled “MacAddicts” to maintain and improve Java on OS X, to at least allow Java developers to run their favorite IDE and test their applications before deploying them on the servers &ndash; keeping the “Write Once, Run Anywhere” a reality (almost&hellip;). The only “bad” part is the fact that “Java Desktop” will not borrow any of the cool features of Apple Mac OS X. Not a big deal, since Java Desktop has never been that successful anyway.</p>

<p>So my advice to fellow Java developers is this: if you care, be vocal.  Let’s make sure Apple lets the community drive the future of Java on Mac, since the future of the Java platform is still very exciting for many of us.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is probably an old tipe, but I have just configured my Windows XP Parallels VMs
to use my MacBook buit-in iSight Web Cam using the driver that you can find here:
- <a href="http://www.maconlysource.com/?p=885">Download iSight Driver for XP</a></p>

<p>The site states that it does not work with Parallels, but I am using the release Build 3170 RC3 and I do not have any issue.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start your VM</li>
<li><p>Download the Driver &amp; Unip zip</p></li>
<li><p>Grab the Built-In iSight using the Devices > USB  menu</p></li>
<li><p>Point the Windows Devices Manager Installer to the location of the Unzipped folder</p></li>

<p>I have installed it and it is really great, easy to use, helping you to create good looking widgets. As usual, like all the Apple development tools it is really intuitive. More than a long blog entry on this I am just pointing you to the DashCode page on the Apple site:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oracle just released on OTN a new product &ldquo;<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/oracle-data-integrator/index.html">Oracle Data Integrator</a>&rdquo; (ODI), I wanted
to quickly take a look to the product, so I have downloaded it and
installed it on my Mac. This product is a 100% Java based solution that
you can quickly installed on mac following these steps:</p>

<p>1- Download and unzip ODI from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/ias/htdocs/101310.html">OTN download page</a> (bottom).</p>

<p>2- Open a terminal Window and go to the folder where you have unzipped
ODI, you should have the following content:</p>

<pre><code>- external
- index.htm
- oracledi
- oracledilwd
- oracledimn
- setup
</code></pre>

<p>Open the index.html and select the Getting Started Guide, this will
help you to learn more about ODI using a comprehensive scenario.</p>

<p>3- Setup the environment variables:</p>

<pre><code>export ODI_JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/Home/   (need to be Java 5)

export ODI_HOME=&lt;path to ODI installation folder&gt;/odi/oracled
</code></pre>

<p>4- Go to the <code>$ODI_HOME/bin</code></p>

<pre><code>cd $ODI_HOME/bin
</code></pre>

<p>5- Start the HSQL databases that contain the sample application and data:</p>

<pre><code>./startdemo.sh &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>This command starts 3 different instances: repo (metadata repository), src (source db), trg (target db) that are used in the Getting Started guide. To stop the DB run the script <code>./stopdemo.sh</code>.</p>

<p>6- You can now start the designer too using the command:</p>

<pre><code>./designer.sh &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>Select the Getting Started project and when you are in the designer switch to the Mac OS X look and feel ;-), using the Menu &ldquo;Look And Feel &gt; Standard &gt; Mac OS X&rdquo;.</p>

<p>These are the first steps to start with Oracle Data Integrator, you can now follow the Getting Started Guide, to learm more about the product, and since your environment is set you can run any of the command documented in this guide.</p>
